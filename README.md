LeetSpeak Word Variation Generator

This script takes a list of words as input and generates various password-like variations of these words using the leet-speak technique. The variations include single word variations, combinations of two words, and combinations with names of seasons and gods.

Input
The input to the script is a text file containing words, with each word on a separate line.

Output
The script generates a text file containing all possible variations of the input words.

Leet-speak technique
Leet-speak is a technique for writing words using character replacements to make the words look like numbers or symbols. The script uses the following replacements:

a -> 4
e -> 3
g -> 6
i -> 1
o -> 0
s -> 5
t -> 7

Usage
To run the script, simply execute the main.py file. The input file and output file names are hardcoded in the script, and can be modified as needed. The default input file is input.txt and the default output file is output.txt.

Example
Given the input file input.txt containing the following words:

secure
The output file output.txt will contain the following variations:
